Working with a community can happen in many different ways and we will try to engage with many of them, including working with other charities and donating when possible, hold events in our space to educate people along with helping to form bonds that will stretch far wider than we could ever do ourselves. We also want to work with schools to help educate kids in a way that schools may not be able to do and to help give children a positive understanding of what they can do for climate change and why. </p><p>One of our commercial products is creating furniture out of cardboard and along with selling this in a shop we also want to work with charities that work in deprived and stretched communities to help distributes these furniture packs to families and households that will really benefit from it. </p><p>We plan to have a big table in the front of the shop that will be used for community events and school visits where will take children through the process of making paper, letting them have a go at making it themselves. When this is happening, we will be able to explain about climate change, what they are doing and why this is helping. We hope this will foster positive relationships where they know the things they can do to help and not feel scared or helpless. As a bonus, in events where you make the paper in the shop it will have to dry for about 36 hours meaning customers have to come back to the shop to collect it which encourage repeat buying and repeat customers. This also means children will have a physical show of what they created which encourages them to explain to people at home how they made it, why etc (And having a product at the end is very exciting and encouraging.)</p><p>Along with this we also host parties and events for both adults and children where we show them how to make paper themselves. The shop gets closed when this happens so we can properly engage with the group. This gives the parties time at the end to look around the shop without the normal nature of an open shop. Some of the money we make at these events goes towards being able to freely give the furniture to the people in need along with income from other aspects.</p></div><aside class="post__aside"><div class="post__share"></div></aside><footer class="post__footer"><div class="post__bio"><div class="post__bio-text"><h3><a href="https://www.boardagain.co.uk/authors/irb/" title="IRB">IRB</a></h3></div></div></footer></article><nav class="post-nav"><div class="post-nav__prev"><a href="https://www.boardagain.co.uk/cardboard-into-paper.html" rel="prev" class="post-nav__link">Previous Post<h5>Cardboard into paper. </h5></a></div></nav></main><footer class="footer"><div class="footer__copyright">Powered by Publii</div></footer></div><script defer="defer" src="https://www.boardagain.co.uk/assets/js/jquery-3.2.1.slim.min.js?v=5f48fc77cac90c4778fa24ec9c57f37d"></script><script defer="defer" src="https://www.boardagain.co.uk/assets/js/scripts.min.js?v=5977caa3bd6c30eab5c559ded3288d58"></script></body></html>
