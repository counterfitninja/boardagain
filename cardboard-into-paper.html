As I mentioned in the <a href="https://www.boardagain.co.uk/cardboard-into-furniture.html"><em>cardboard into furniture</em></a> page, the 3 main types of cardboard we will get include single layer corrugated cardboard that is not strong enough to make into furniture. Instead, we use it to create paper.</strong> </p><p><em><u>-How we do this.</u></em> We start by shredding the cardboard into thin, short strips (about 3mm by 2cm). This makes it much quicker for the strips to absorb the water in the next step and it take up less space.</p><p>Next, we add all the shreddings into a large bucket with enough water to cover all the pieces. This sits for at least 4 hours, or until it is all soft. this creates our pulp.</p><p>Next, we blend this with double the amount of water to form a thin, creamy liquidly pulp. For paper with decorative elements like dried flowers, they will be added now.</p><p>This mixture is poured into a shallow basin and a deckle (a wooden frame with thin mesh stretched across one side) is submerged into the mixture so the fibres can settle in a thin layer on the deckle. It is then pulled out carefully and any excess water drains out the bottom.</p><p>We then flip this on dry towels or old t-shirts and use a rag to absorb as much water as possible.</p><p>We carefully remove the deckle, leaving a layer of fibres that will dry into a sheet of paper. To create thicker, sketchbook paper we press two layers together. Once dried they will be pealed of the rags and made into the different products.</p><p><em><u>-product 1, sketchbooks and notebooks.</u></em> We use the paper in this way to create ring bound sketchbooks and notebooks. The sketchbooks are 2 layers of paper, making them stronger to things like paints. This comes in A4 and A5 size.  The notebooks are a single layer as they are intended for notetaking or sketching. We make this in A5 sizes with the option of lined or blank pages. </p><p><em><u>-Product 2, craft paper packs.</u></em> We use natural dyes to create coloured paper and add things like dried petals to make interesting paper for crafting and scrapbooking. </p><p><em><u>-product 3, cards and invitations. </u></em>The final product uses the same paper for the notebooks, but we create cards with blank insides and simple but cute designs on the front that are produced by a team member then printed on the front. We also print packs of cards with a simple outline for things like party or wedding invitations. </p><p>Overall, this paper will not be white like you would normally get because of the colour of the cardboard used although it will be a more muted version. There is no way around it without bleaching it, which we will not be doing. Some people don’t like the nature of the colour, but you will find most are unbothered. This paper also naturally has more texture as it is not compressed or made in the same way as commercial paper is, but it gives it a nice sensory bonus that is not super noticeable but is quite fun. </p></div><aside class="post__aside"><div class="post__share"></div></aside><footer class="post__footer"><div class="post__bio"><div class="post__bio-text"><h3><a href="https://www.boardagain.co.uk/authors/irb/" title="IRB">IRB</a></h3></div></div></footer></article><nav class="post-nav"><div class="post-nav__prev"><a href="https://www.boardagain.co.uk/cardboard-into-furniture.html" rel="prev" class="post-nav__link">Previous Post<h5>Cardboard into furniture. </h5></a></div><div class="post-nav__next"><a href="https://www.boardagain.co.uk/events-schools-education-community.html" rel="next" class="post-nav__link">Next Post<h5>Events, schools, education, community</h5></a></div></nav></main><footer class="footer"><div class="footer__copyright">Powered by Publii</div></footer></div><script defer="defer" src="https://www.boardagain.co.uk/assets/js/jquery-3.2.1.slim.min.js?v=5f48fc77cac90c4778fa24ec9c57f37d"></script><script defer="defer" src="https://www.boardagain.co.uk/assets/js/scripts.min.js?v=5977caa3bd6c30eab5c559ded3288d58"></script></body></html>
