Corrugated. You will find single, double and triple layer corrugated cardboard with single and double being the most common out of the three. We can separate out the single layer to recycle into paper and take the doubler and triple to use for the furniture. The ideas will be very similar to how Ikea packs their furniture with flat pieces that are easy to assemble. We will create 2 different types of furniture packs, one that we will distribute to other companies and charities that support these communities. For example, Fair Frome is a charity that does similar where we live. The other pack will be sold in the shop and include just the cardbo</strong><strong style="font-size: inherit;">ard pieces. </strong></p><p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><em>-Pack One</em></span>. This pack will include the flat pieces of furniture, strong adhesive paper tape and instructions on how to assemble. This pack will be distributed by us and companies like Fair Frome to the communities who will benefit from this. This will have no cost. </p><p><em><span style="text-decoration: underline;">-Pack Two.</span></em> This will be sold in person in our shop and will include the flat pieces of furniture and instructions on how to assemble. This will be sold as cheaply for anyone who wishes to buy it. </p><p>The packs we offer include: Beds, Coffee tables, Booksh<span style="font-size: inherit;">elves, Sofas, Armchairs.</span></p><p><strong>How we make the pieces. </strong></p><p>For example, making a bed frame is relatively simple and requires the least amount of construction by the buyer. We take the triple layer cardboard and cut it into strips that can slot into each other in a way that makes a lattice, honeycomb pattern base. this base is very strong, but it can also be pushed together, taking up much less space. Alternatively, the pieces can be slotted into each other and packed completely flat. The only problem with this is the base could move or bunch up on itself when<span style="font-size: inherit;"> spaced out under a mattress, so we also provide a frame the slots on top and around the sides,</span><span style="font-size: inherit;"> meaning it stays in place securely, has a clean lo</span><span style="font-size: inherit;">ok and a flat surface to lay the mattress on.</span></p><p>Everything is<span style="font-size: inherit;"> made by hand b</span><span style="font-size: inherit;">y Board Again stalf.  </span><span style="font-size: inherit;">        </span></p><p>  </p></div><aside class="post__aside"><div class="post__share"></div></aside><footer class="post__footer"><div class="post__bio"><div class="post__bio-text"><h3><a href="https://www.boardagain.co.uk/authors/irb/" title="IRB">IRB</a></h3></div></div></footer></article><nav class="post-nav"><div class="post-nav__prev"><a href="https://www.boardagain.co.uk/who-we-are.html" rel="prev" class="post-nav__link">Previous Post<h5>Who we are. </h5></a></div><div class="post-nav__next"><a href="https://www.boardagain.co.uk/cardboard-into-paper.html" rel="next" class="post-nav__link">Next Post<h5>Cardboard into paper. </h5></a></div></nav></main><footer class="footer"><div class="footer__copyright">Powered by Publii</div></footer></div><script defer="defer" src="https://www.boardagain.co.uk/assets/js/jquery-3.2.1.slim.min.js?v=5f48fc77cac90c4778fa24ec9c57f37d"></script><script defer="defer" src="https://www.boardagain.co.uk/assets/js/scripts.min.js?v=5977caa3bd6c30eab5c559ded3288d58"></script></body></html>
